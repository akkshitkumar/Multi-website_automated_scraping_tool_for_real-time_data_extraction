Recommendation systems are an essential component of machine learning algorithms that make relevant recommendations to users based on their requests. Machine learning techniques have sparked a surge of interest in recommender systems. Because there are so many implicit and explicit features that may be utilised to estimate user preference, scalable and accurate algorithms are required, as well as a system that is highly available and scalable. As the demand for e-commerce websites grows, so does the amount of information accessible, making it harder for consumers to discover relevant information that matches their interests. This challenge is solved by recommender systems, which search through a massive amount of dynamically created data to present users with tailored content and services. To implement the recommendation system, a variety of machine learning approaches can be employed. Content-Based Filtering, Hybrid Content-Collaborative Based Filtering and Collaborative Based Filtering are among these strategies.
